Learning about the origins of open source has been fascinating to me. I find it very interesting that in a world driven by profits, so much software exists created without the concern of making money. Many of the pioneers of the Open Source world, such as Linus Torvalds, Danese Cooper, and Tim Berners-Lee, created projects out of genuine interest and a desire to make software more accessible and transparent. The open source paradigm also makes it relatively easy for small personal projects to gain the rapid interest of other enthusiasts and quickly grow into something much bigger. Linus Torvalds started Linux as a personal project in his dorm room, but grew into one of the most influential operating systems and pieces of software ever created.
While my group has not picked a specific project yet, we have a very narrow list and a pretty good idea of the type of project that we would like to work on. Right now, we are in between choosing Pandas, MuseScore, or Jupyter Notebook. Most of us in our group have an interest in music and/or data science, and these projects seem to allow us to merge those interests with open source. Also, all of these projects seem very approachable for us given our skill sets and have very active communities, which we value.
