This week, I chose to watch the videos about open source technology for education. I thought both videos were very
enlightening and opened my eyes to an application of open source technology that I had not previously considered. The videos mainly focused on textbooks that are created as Open Education Resources, specifically through the project OpenStax, founded by Richard Baraniuk, a professor of engineering at Rice University. The textbooks through this project are all publicly available for free, which is a complete game changer for countless students who may have struggled with current extreme costs of standard textbooks. These textbooks have enormous possibilities and prevent students from spending additional money on new textbooks each semester. Furthermore, since these textbooks are open source, they are able to be copied and modified by any professor who chooses to use them in class. This allows professors to modify certain chapters and information to better suit their specific needs for teaching the course. This modifiability allows specific textbooks to be used in possibly significantly more classes than traditional textbooks as professors can customize the information to suit their lesson plans. I am excited at the prospects of what open source technology can bring to the classroom in the future.
