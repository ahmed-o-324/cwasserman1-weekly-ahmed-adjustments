title: Week 10

This week, I have been working with my group on finding issues on the MuseScore repository that seem doable and approachable. We have also been getting in contact with the maintainers of the MuseScore repository in the discord, discussing possible starting points and feature additions. I have now been assigned an issue that I told the project maintainers that I would be happy to take on.
My first issue that I will attempt to tackle on the MuseScore repository is that a specific function called accidentalType, when called, does not return an integer. I am going to investigate the issue and attempt to remedy it.
