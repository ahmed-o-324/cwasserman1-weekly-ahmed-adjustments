This past week I have worked with my group to create our browser extension called insult reminders. This is the first open source project that I have worked on as well as the first browser extension I have tried to make. It has been a little bit difficult to style the browser extension as well as to get the html to correctly update with the JavaScript but it is doable. This has been a great learning experience as I have been able to practice working on a team with an open source project. I am excited to continue to contribute and develop this project.
The in-class activity on git was very helpful. While I have used Git before, I have not thought critically about what each command is actually doing. I have only ever been a collaborator on a project, so I have never had to deal with upstreams and forking repositories which I found can add a layer of complexity to using Git.
