I have thoroughly enjoyed looking through all of the different projects. I find it fascinating that there are open source projects relating to nearly every subject matter and in every field. There are so many options of choices of open source projects to contribute to that it can be overwhelming. In regards to working on an open source project, I am most excited about contributing something to a project that I have used before. My main choices right now are MuseScore, which I have used extensively to find sheet music, and Pandas, which I have used in the workplace and in school to analyze datasets. I think my biggest hurdle will be finding issues that I can meaningfully tackle with the knowledge that I currently have. I plan on reading lots of documentation and combing through issues to find problems that I will be able to tackle.
